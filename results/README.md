# OrbitAI Ground Operations and Results
- Ground operations are summarized in [OPERATIONS.md](OPERATIONS.md).
- Results are presented in [RESULTS.md](RESULTS.md).

Note that the csv files in the `data` folder are downlinked from the spacecraft and have an invalid header becaues of [Issue #10](https://github.com/georgeslabreche/opssat-orbitai/issues/10). Each of these files have thus been manually fixed and saved as new files with the "_headerfix" suffix.
