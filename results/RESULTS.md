# OrbitAI Results
Confusion matrices and classification metrics for the models trained by the OrbitAI app on-board the spacecraft.

## Run #1
Initial training of models. The polled data pool param training inputs were not diverse enough during this run:
- The PD6 sun elevation angle training inputs ranged from 0 to 0.65 radians.
- Further training runs are required to cover inputs ranges from 1.05 to 1.57 radians.

## Run #2
Continued training.
## Run #3
Continued training
